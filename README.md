### Clan Ranks in the Broadcast

Messages sent to Discord display your clan rank icon next to your name making it easy to distinguish members.

## Plugin Setup

1. Search for **RuneConnect** in the RuneLite Plugin Hub and install it.
2. In your clan's Discord server, run `/setup runelite-link` (requires Manage Server permission) to get a link token.

4. That's it. Clan chat and coffer transactions will post to your server's configured channels.

## What data this plugin sends

- **Clan Chat messages**: your character name and message text, for every message sent in clan chat.
- **Coffer transaction details**: transaction type, amount, and the character name who performed it.
- **A screenshot of your RuneLite Client**, taken at the moment of each coffer transaction.
- **Rank Icon Images**: A small icon per clan rank, sent once the first time it's encountered.

No data is sent unless a valid Discord Link Token is configured. All data goes only to RuneConnect's own server; this plugin does not communicate with any other third party.
